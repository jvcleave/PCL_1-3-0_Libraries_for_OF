// .NAME vtkMNIObjectWriter - A writer for MNI surface mesh files.
// .SECTION Description
// The MNI .obj file format is used to store geometrical data.  This
// file format was developed at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre at
// the Montreal Neurological Institute and is used by their software.
// Only polygon and line files are supported by this writer.  For these
// formats, all data elements are written including normals, colors,
// and surface properties.  ASCII and binary file types are supported.
// .SECTION See Also
// vtkMINCImageReader vtkMNIObjectReader vtkMNITransformReader
// .SECTION Thanks
// Thanks to David Gobbi for writing this class and Atamai Inc. for
// contributing it to VTK.
