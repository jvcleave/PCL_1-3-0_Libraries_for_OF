\section{Relative Size Squared\label{s:quad-rel-size-squared}}

The relative size squared metric is defined as
\[
q = \left( \min\left\{ \frac{A}{\overline{A}}, \frac{\overline{A}}{A} \right\} \right)^2
\]
where $A$ is the area of the element as defined in \S\ref{s:quad-area}
and $\overline{A}$ is the average of $A$ over all of the elements in the
ensemble of elements being considered.
It is the square of the minimum of the ratio of quad area to the average quad area and its inverse.

Note that if $\overline{A} < DBL\_MIN$ or $A < DBL\_MIN$, we take $q = 0$.
