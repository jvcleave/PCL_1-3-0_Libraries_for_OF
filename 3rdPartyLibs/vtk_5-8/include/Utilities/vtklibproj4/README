This constitutes "release" 3 of libproj4.  This release changes
the name space to "proj_" prefix of all global identifiers.  Also,
this release should be 'thread-safe' except for proj_rtodms() which
is *not* used by any of the library procedures.

This file takes the place of a "configure" system which is
far too complex for this humble peon to figure out how to use.

Fortunately, the libproj4 system is easy to install and should
be quite portable across Unix, Linux operating systems.  Typical
sequence is to:

make libproj4
make lproj
make install

But before doing the above please examine the beginning of the
Makefile and adjust the options at the beginning of the Makefile.  For
installation the default destination directories are in the home
directory of the installer.  To make the library and lproj executable
easily usable by other users modify the directory base set by the
parameter 'prefix.' You may have to be super user to use some of the
settings.

        -----  T H R E A D S ----

To make libproj4 threads friendly, use "THEADS=1".  Any program using
thelibrary will have to reference '-lpthread' library.  If one is
never interested in thread program comment out the option.

The library procedure proj_rtodms is not threads friendly but it is *not*
used by any projection routine and is supplied as a supplementary
procedure.

This is some contention between 'info' documentation and GNU software
regarding the implementation of the 'strerror_r' function.  Non-GNU
standards require integer return whereas GNU default implementation
returns a pointer to a string---not compatible with threads.

                -----  N O T I C E -----

The Mayr projection requires the use of the Gnu Scientific Library
for the general case usage where the +n= option is employed.  The
distributed form of the Makefile excludes this option by commenting
out the line reading "GSL=1".  When the library is compiled in
this manner trying "+proj=mayr +n=" will cause a failure.  To enable
the full function of the mayr remove the # from the GSL=1 line before
compiling the library.  Note: when the library is compiled in this
manner any program using the library will also have to link with
the GSL library.

As always, please submit any bugs to the author at:

PS: the release/version of libproj4 is based upon the date that forms
the name of the distribution file and the name of a null file in this
directory.  Each program/header file will have its own revision/date
entry.
